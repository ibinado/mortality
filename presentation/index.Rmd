## Mortality Rate Predictor

* What is it?
* Why would anybody want it?

## Underlying Mortality Rate Data

Mortality rates are based on data from the
[CDC WONDER Online Database](http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html).

The graph below shows the overall yearly mortality rate by age across all population groups.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=12, fig.align='center'}
load('../mortality.data')
m <- mortality
m <- split(m[, c('Deaths', 'Population')], m$Age)
m <- lapply(m, function(x) { colSums(x) })
mortalityRate.PerYear <- sapply(m, function(x) {
  x['Deaths'] / x['Population']
})
plot(100 * mortalityRate.PerYear,
     xlab='age [years]',
     ylab='yearly mortality rate [%]',
     main='US Mortality Rate for 2013',
     type = 'o', cex=0.5)
```

## Prediction Algorithm

From the yearly mortality rate data we predict the mortality rate over the precition time range with the following formula:

$$overall\_mortality\_rate = 1 - \displaystyle\prod_{age=start}^{end} (1 - morality\_rate_{age})$$
